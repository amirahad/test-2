Improve Data Management Page (UI + Features)
🎨 UI & Design Improvements
Align with other pages’ layout and color scheme:

Set consistent padding (p-6) and spacing across all components.

Use white background for cards (bg-white) with soft shadow (shadow-md) and rounded corners (rounded-lg).

Apply consistent button styles (bg-blue-600, text-white, hover:bg-blue-700) as used in other pages (e.g., Reports, Properties).

Headers and section spacing:

Add clear headers: “📥 Import Data” and “📤 Export Data”.

Use larger headings (text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800) and smaller description texts (text-sm text-gray-500).

Add dividers (border-b border-gray-200 my-4) between sections for visual clarity.
