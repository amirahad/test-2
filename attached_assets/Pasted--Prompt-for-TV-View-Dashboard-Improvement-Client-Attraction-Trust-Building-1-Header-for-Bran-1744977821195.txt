ðŸ“º Prompt for TV View Dashboard Improvement (Client Attraction & Trust Building)

1. Header for Branding (Essential)Clearly include:

Agency Logo (top-left corner, moderate size, clear visibility)

Agency Name (next to logo, clear font, bold, easily readable from distance)

2. UI/Design Improvements

Keep consistent rounded corners and clear padding (p-8) in widgets/cards.

Clearly use subtle gradients within each widget, rather than plain solid colors, for a more professional look.

Slightly reduce font sizes of metric numbers to balance clarity and elegance.

Clearly include subtle shadows (shadow-xl) behind widgets for a more attractive appearance.

3. Analytics to Clearly Display (Client-Centric & Attractive)These should immediately highlight the agencyâ€™s strengths clearly and positively:

Properties Sold (This Month & Year-to-Date; clearly indicates agency success)

Total Sales Revenue (This Month; conveys strong agency market presence)

Average Selling Price (Recent Settlements; demonstrates agency handling premium properties)

Average Days on Market (Shorter duration impresses potential clients)

4. Optional Analytics to Add (Consider clearly if data reflects positively)

Client Satisfaction (clearly show as a high percentage or star rating, if available)

Recent Notable Sales (Clearly cycle through high-profile property images with sold prices)

Top Suburbs (Highlight suburbs where the agency frequently sells, building local expertise credibility)

5. Alignment with Other Dashboard Pages

Maintain consistent typography (fonts, sizes) and color themes (primary colors: blue, green, gold, purple)

Maintain UI consistency, ensuring TV dashboard uses same style as the internal dashboard but clearly simplified for client viewing.

6. Visual Enhancements for Attractiveness

Add subtle transition animations between data refreshes for smooth and visually appealing experience.

Ensure data clearly auto-refreshes (every 30 min) without noticeable disruptions.

Clearly indicate timestamp with a gentle note such as "Updated just now" or "Live Data."
