Improve /reports Page to Add Report Creation Functionality
🎯 Objective
Transform the current /reports page into an interactive Sales Report Creator where users can:

Generate custom reports for the entire agency or specific agents

Add modular analytics/widgets to the report

Export reports as PDF (client-ready)

Keep UI consistent with the rest of the dashboard

🪄 UI Design Guidelines
Use the same layout, font, and spacing as other pages (p-6, rounded-lg, bg-white, text-gray-800)

Align cards and charts in a grid layout (2 or 3 columns)

Use existing color themes:

Blue: Properties Sold

Green: Revenue

Amber: Average Price

Purple: Days on Market

🛠️ Functionality to Implement (Step-by-Step)
1. Report Type Selection
Add toggle or dropdown:

Report for Agency (default)

Report by Agent (dropdown list of agents)

On agent selection, all charts and data adjust to reflect agent-specific metrics

2. Time Range Filter
Same options as dashboard:

30 Days, 90 Days, 6 Months, 12 Months, Custom Range

3. Widget Library (Drag or Add to Report)
Create a library panel (sidebar or modal) where users can select which data widgets to include in the report:

📊 Widget Options to Add:

Total Properties Sold (with trend line)

Total Revenue (line chart or value)

Average Selling Price (value or bar chart)

Average Days on Market

Sales by Property Type (pie chart)

Sales by Suburb (map or bar graph)

Commission Earned

Top 5 Sales (list with price and suburb)

Agent Leaderboard (if generating agency-wide report)

👉 Each widget should have:

Add/Remove button

Preview option

Auto-align into printable report layout

4. Report Preview Panel
Real-time preview area on the right or below

Shows selected widgets/cards in stacked layout

Allow reordering widgets (drag & drop or up/down buttons)

5. Report Title & Notes
Input fields:

Report Title

Optional notes/description area (for comments or context)

6. Export Options
Export as PDF (Client-ready formatting)

Save template (optional feature for repeat reports)
